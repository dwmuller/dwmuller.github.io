# Pending Site Improvement Tasks
- Migrate more pages out of OneNote and other locations.
- Investigate further aesthetic improvement
    - [Tailwind](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/installation)? Requires [PostCSS](https://blog.alexdevero.com/postcss-quick-introduction/), which requires either a global install of postcss-cli, or a task runner/bundler (of which there are a whole hell of a lot to choose from).
    - Need some graphics/pictures. Yeah, they don't add utility, but still.
- Add search.
- Consider best ways to do relative references between notes.
- Find a method of validating links. Incorporate it into Actions.
- Investigate pros/cons of Nunjucks et al vs. Liquid.
