# Pending Site Improvement Tasks
- Apply some styling to this site. (Please!!!) Investigate wrapper templates.
- Investigate pros/cons of Nunjucks et al vs. Liquid.
- Migrate more pages out of OneNote and other locations.
- Consider best ways to do relative references between notes.
- Find a method of validating links. Incorporate it into Actions.
- Investigate HTTP caching and updates, and/or browser pushes, to get immediate updates, esp. from local repo when testing changes. Interestingly, changes to most pages seem to get pushed, but changes to the top index.html do not.
