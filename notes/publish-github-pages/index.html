    <h1>How to Publish GitHub Pages Using Actions</h1>
<p>There are lots of articles on this topic, but here are important things that tend to be omitted from other articles.</p>
<p>If you're using the <code>peaceiris/actions-gh-pages</code> package to deploy the built site from a GitHub Action, note that it
&quot;deploys&quot; the build results by checking the site into the gh-pages branch (by default). This is fine for a
site associated with a project, but can be surprising for a user or organization GitHub pages project, which
by default publishes the <code>main</code> branch. You can change the branch that is published in the repository's
settings. Change it to gh-pages.</p>
<p>Since you're not using Jekyll (the static site generator directly supported by GitHub), it may be a good idea to
add a <code>.nojekyll</code> flag file to your project. This prevents some behavior/activity that you don't need.</p>
