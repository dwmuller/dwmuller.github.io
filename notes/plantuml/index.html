<h1>Using PlantUML</h1>
<p>On Linux, by default, the Java engine will try to connect to X. This is a problem when trying
to run the PlantUML CLI non-interactively. The quick fix is to include a Java option in the
command line to force &quot;headless mode&quot;. Example:</p>
<pre><code>plantuml -Djava.awt.headless=true -tpnt my-uml-file.plantuml
</code></pre>
