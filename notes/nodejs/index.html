<h1>Notes on Node.js</h1>
<h2>Installing on Ubuntu/Debian</h2>
<p>As of March 2021, the official apt package for Ubuntu 20.4 was way out of date. This article discusses several options for installing it:</p>

</ul>
<p>I used option 3, installing NVM to manage multiple versions of Node.js, since I anticipate working on multiple projects from various sources that are not all on the same version. Specifically, since nvm is a shell script available as a GitHub project, I included it as a submodule in <a href="https://github.com/dwmuller/dotfiles">my dotfiles</a> project. This makes NVM readily available to me in all my development environments.</p>
<p>Once you have NVM, you can investigate available versions of Node.js using the ls-remote and version-remote commands. E.g. to see the latest long-term support version:</p>
<pre><code>nvm version-remote --lts
</code></pre>
<p>or to see all LTS versions:</p>
<pre><code>nvm ls-remote --lts
</code></pre>
<p>See nvm's help for more. Installing multiple versions, and choosing the active version, are all easy. Works on Windows in Git Bash, although you may need to enable <a href="symbolic-links-on-windows">Symbolic links on Windows</a>.</p>
