<h1>Pending Site Improvement Tasks</h1>
<ul>
<li>Apply some styling to this site. (Please!!!) Investigate wrapper templates.</li>
<li>Investigate pros/cons of Nunjucks et al vs. Liquid.</li>
<li>Migrate more pages out of OneNote and other locations.</li>
<li>Consider best ways to do relative references between notes.</li>
<li>Find a method of validating links. Incorporate it into Actions.</li>
<li>Investigate HTTP caching and updates, and/or browser pushes, to get immediate updates, esp. from local repo when testing changes. Interestingly, changes to most pages seem to get pushed, but changes to the top index.html do not.</li>
</ul>
