<h1>Eleventy (11ty) Static Site Generator</h1>
<p>This site is built using <a href="https://www.11ty.dev/">Eleventy</a>. I chose it
because it uses javascript, which I want to learn better, and it takes
a minimalist approach, allowing me to start with a very simple site setup.</p>
<p>The main things to know:</p>
<ul>
<li>All input files are referred to as &quot;templates&quot; in the docs ...</li>
<li>... because by default they are processed by the <code>liquid</code> templating engine.</li>
</ul>
<h1>Daily usage</h1>
<p>Build the static site from sources, by default the output goes to _site.</p>
<pre><code>npx @11ty/eleventy
</code></pre>
<p>To serve the project up locally, in a way that will automatically update as you modify the source files:</p>
<pre><code>npx @11ty/eleventy --serve
</code></pre>
<p>TODO: The eleventy site suggests using npx instead of npm, haven't investigated why.</p>
<h1>Installation</h1>
<p>You need Node.js. See (my notes)[nodejs] on installing it.</p>
<p>Install npm.</p>
<pre><code>npm install -g npm
</code></pre>
<p>If you're working on an existing eleventy project, clone it to a local repo and cd into it. Run <code>npm install</code> to install all the project's dependencies. You're done.</p>
<p>If you are setting up a new project, create a new repo, cd into it, and initialize it as a Node.js project:</p>
<pre><code>npm init -y
</code></pre>
<p>Install Eleventy in this project, as a tool that's needed only for development (not production):</p>
<pre><code>npm install --save-dev @11ty/eleventy
</code></pre>
<p>Add a .gitignore file. You can find templates online for Node.js projects. Or if you created the repo on GitHub, you can add a .gitignore file in GitHub's Web interface, and it will offer templates you can choose from. In any case, add a  line containing <code>sites/</code> to .gitignore so that eleventy's outputs don't get checked in.</p>
<p>Now refer to the Daily usage section above.</p>
<h1>Publishing via GitHub pages</h1>
<p>There are lots of articles on this topic, but here are important things that tended to be glossed over.</p>
<p>If you're using the <code>peaceiris/actions-gh-pages</code> package to deploy the built site from a GitHub Action, note that it
&quot;deploys&quot; the build results by checking the site into the gh-pages branch (by default). This is fine for a
site associated with a project, but can be surprising for a user or organization GitHub pages project, which
by default publishes the <code>main</code> branch. You can change the branch that is published in the repository's
settings. Change it to gh-pages.</p>
<p>Since you're not using Jekyll (the static site generator directly supported by GitHub), it may be a good idea to
add a <code>.nojekyll</code> flag file to your project. This prevents some behavior/activity that you don't need.</p>
